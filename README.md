# Restuarant Management Program üç¥

## ‚ö° Intro
This program was made in my first year of college as a small project.\
I started to know my way around C language at that time and managed to some\
degree to implement it here.
This project taught me the process of finding errors,\
the allocation and realease of memory in C and teamwork.
